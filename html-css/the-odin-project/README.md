Hi! This is a repository for various minor tutorial projects and scratch work that I have done. Things are organized by primary language, and typically from there by which resource I was following in creating it. Projects in this directory are typically minor and solely created for learning purposes. Projects that get much larger in scope, serve potential use for others, or may serve as strong portfolio pieces may be removed from this directory and placed into their own repositories.
